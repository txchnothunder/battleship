# Battleship Game

## Overview

This project implements a classical, fully functional Battleship game in the terminal using Python. The game allows a player to play against an AI bot opponent with intelligent decision-making capabilities, simulating human-like gameplay.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/txchonthunder/battleship.git
cd battleship/
```

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to place your ships and make guesses to sink the AI's ships.

- The coordinates that should be entered should be in the format of A1, A2, etc.
- The player's and enemy's board will be randomly generated
- A winner will be determined when all of the enemy's ships have been hit and sunk
